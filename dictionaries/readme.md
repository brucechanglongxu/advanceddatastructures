One hash function we can choose is a "totally random" hash function, where we uniformly at random choose an element in the range to assign to an element in the domain in order to generate our hash function. Another hash function that we can observe is a universal hash function, which we restrict the hash function space to a smaller family H' 

2. Simple tabulation hashing
3. Chaining and perfect hashing
4. Linear probing
5. Cuckoo hashing
