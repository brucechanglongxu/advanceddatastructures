**RMQ:** We would like to preprocess an array of n numbers. And we would like to construct the following query:

1. query(A, i, j) : This returns the minimum element in A between the indices i and j

**LCA:** We would like to preprocess the rooted tree, and construct the following query.

2. Find the youngest anestor of both x and y.

**LA:** Provided with a rooted tree, we would like to query the k-th ancestor of the x-node within our tree.
